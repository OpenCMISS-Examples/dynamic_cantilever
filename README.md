# dynamic_cantilever
Dyanamic finite elastic cantilever.

This example solves the dynamic finite elasticity equations (without damping) for a cantilever undergoing a sinuosoidal displacement boundary condition at the end of the cantilever. The cantilever has material properties consistent with silicon rubber.
